THE BIG TODO LIST:
- Eta reduction
- Rewrite parser to be non-recursive
- LSP support
  - Allow attributes such as `#[lsp("comment")]` in grammars
- Paramatricity
  - New keyword `paramatricity x`, generates inductor
  - Formalize generating inductor from paramatricity
- Allow leaving out the type in FnConstruct, so you can do `x => x`
- Allow binder chains
  - (v1: T1) (v2: T2) v3 => ...
  - (T1: Type) (T2: Type) (:T3) -> ...
- Add a timeout to the exhaustive tests
- Remove RuleAction, instead returning ActionResults with environments
- Pass flag around in context whether result of parse is needed
- queued_tc
- Multi-file support
  - Make `program` part of self in TcEnv
- Add type checking to grammar adaptation
